<h1>Code 1230 Assignment 1</h1>

<p>Urban Transformation, which is also referred to as Urban Renewal, is the improvement and sometimes replacement of buildings in a city,
 especially of whole neighbourhoods of housing as defined by the Cambridge Dictionary. In the chosen examples, the New York EastSide
 Coastal Resiliency Project, and Sydney's Barangaroo Project, Urban Transformation defines the change that is occurring or is in planning
 for these respective projects.

 New York ESCR Project
 
 <br><br>
 The New York ESCR Project aims to improve eco-freindliness and the strength of the the city around its coastal structures, through its implementation of flood barriers 
 that protect the city form coastal floodings. These flood barriers are acheived by creating new eco-friendly green areas/parks that are raised high 
 enough to block flood water. This project also allows the raising of roadways, creating new community water front space underneath.
